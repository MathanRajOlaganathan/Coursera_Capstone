 IBM Data Science Capstone Project

As part of the Coursera Capstone Project (https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/week/4), I have come with the problem of exploring different venues in the neighborhood of Bangalore and suggest the best places to open a seafood restaurant. The objective of this project is to explore different venues in the city for each neighborhood and come up with useful metrics like top 10 venue categories in the city, the neighborhood with most venues, a map view of the neighborhood along with their venues in different colors. Adding to it, the clustering of the neighborhood having a seafood restaurant will be done to show the areas for new investment.
