    "  As part of the Coursera Capstone Project (https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/week/4), I have come with the problem of exploring different venues in Bangalore, India.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In a busy city like Bangalore, finding the right venue for our needs is a hectic task. Be it restaurants, bars, cafes, etc there are so many options for us to choose from and especially for tourists, it's even more time-consuming.\n",
    "Bangalore covers an area of 741 square KM with 55 neighborhoods. The objective of this project is to explore different venues in the city, gather ratings and come up with useful metrics like the top venues based on their ratings, the map showing venues in a different color based on their similarity, etc. Adding to it, the clustering of venues will be done to show the areas for new investment. With this information, people can plan for trips and select the right place with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using Foursquare data to nearby venues for 55 Neighborhoods and Zomato API to get ratings, price, etc information for all the venues. And kmeans to cluster the similar venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Target Audience\n",
    "This project will help the following users,\n",
    "        \n",
    "   - Anyone who wants to visit Bangalore can use the project analysis report, maps to plan the venues that match their expectation. \n",
    "   - Anyone who wants to start a new restaurant/cafe can lookup the cluster maps and the report to select the best place for their investment.\n",
    "   - And the future city projects can be planned according to the existing venues by making use of the venue's maps and plots. \n",
